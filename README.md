# SingleFuncParcel_ABCD
Data and codes for our paper **"Hierarchical individual variation and socioeconomic impact on personalized functional network topography in children"**.

Here, we delineated 17 *personalized functional networks* for Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (**ABCD**) children using 20 min high-quality fMRI data and a machine learning approach. We have publicly shared this resource at  https://nda.nih.gov/study.html?id=2484. 

We explored whether *personalized functional network topography* can be used to predict individualsâ€™ socioeconomic status (**SES**) factors, including family income, parental education, and neighborhood disadvantages. We discovered that associations between functional topography and SES factors were hierarchically patterned on the cortex along the sensorimotor-association (**S-A**) cortical axis.  

## `scripts`
- The [stpe01_participantsSelection](stpe01_participantsSelection/) folder contains scripts used to select participants used for  *personalized functional networks* construction and SES prediction.

- The [step02_singleParcel_NMF](step02_singleParcel_NMF/) folder contains scripts used to generate personalized functional network topography with non-negative matrix factorization (**NMF**) for ABCD children and scripts used to get results of *Figure 1* and *Figure 2*.

- The [step03_SESprediction](step03_SESprediction/) folder contains scripts used to create topography feature used for SES prediction, perform partial least squares regression (**PLS-R**) and scripts used to get results of *Figure 3*, *Figure 4* and *Figure 5*.

- The [step04_associationWithSArank](step04_associationWithSArank) folder contains scripts used to perform association analysis with S-A gradient and scripts used to get results of *Figure 2* and *Figure 3/4/5* .

- The [step05_singleParcel_MSHBM](step05_singleParcel_MSHBM) folder contains scripts used to generate personalized atlas label with the multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (**MS-HBM**).

- The [step06_supplementaryAnalyses](step06_supplementaryAnalyses) folder contains atlas label (both NMF and MS-HBM) prediction with PLS-R and atlas loading prediction with ridge regression and scripts used to get results of *Supplementary Figure 6-9*.
